One important thing to note about using website tools is that while these tools are added to websites within the `website` key, in a book you should include the same options in the `book` key. For example, in a website you would include a favicon and twitter card as follows:

```yaml
website:
  favicon: logo.png
  twitter-card: true
  site-url: https://example.com
```

In a book you'd use the `book` key instead:

```yaml
book:
  favicon: logo.png
  twitter-card: true
  site-url: https://example.com
```
